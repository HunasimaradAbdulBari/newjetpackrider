# Games Boilerplate 🎮

This repository provides a **boilerplate setup** for building game applications.  
👉 All collaborators must **strictly follow the guidelines below** 



1. **Use the Boilerplate Only**  
   - All games must be built **inside the provided boilerplate code**.  
   - Do not create separate projects/files or move core logic outside the boilerplate.

2. **Code Quality Before Pushing**  
   - Ensure there are **no type errors, runtime errors, or bugs** in your game before pushing.  
   - Run the project locally and test your changes thoroughly.
   - Each file should not have more than max of 500-700 lines.

3. **Questions Array Format**  
   - The `questions` array **must be stored in the format provided** in the main game rendering file.  
   - ⚠️ Do **not** store or duplicate the questions array anywhere else.
